Important nodes
0%
Here, you'll learn about ways of identifying nodes that are important in a network. In doing so, you'll be introduced to more advanced concepts in network analysis as well as learn the basics of path-finding algorithms. The chapter concludes with a deep dive into the Twitter network dataset which will reinforce the concepts you've learned, such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality.

This chapter is all about finding interesting structures within network data. You'll learn about essential concepts such as cliques, communities, and subgraphs, which will leverage all of the skills you acquired in Chapter 2. By the end of this chapter, you'll be ready to apply the concepts you've learned to a real-world case study.

In this final chapter of the course, you'll consolidate everything you've learned by diving into an in-depth case study of GitHub collaborator network data. This is a great example of real-world social network data, and your newly acquired skills will be fully tested. By the end of this chapter, you'll have developed your very own recommendation system which suggests GitHub users who should collaborate together. Enjoy!
