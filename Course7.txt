Tidying data for analysis

Here, you'll learn about the principles of tidy data and more importantly, why you should care about them and how they make subsequent data analysis more efficient. You'll gain first hand experience with reshaping and tidying your data using techniques such as pivoting and melting.

Combining data for analysis
0%
The ability to transform and combine your data is a crucial skill in data science, because your data may not always come in one monolithic file or table for you to load. A large dataset may be broken into separate datasets to facilitate easier storage and sharing. Or if you are dealing with time series data, for example, you may have a new dataset for each day. No matter the reason, it is important to be able to combine datasets so you can either clean a single dataset, or clean each dataset separately and then combine them later so you can run your analysis on a single dataset. In this chapter, you'll learn all about combining data.

Cleaning data for analysis
0%
Here, you'll dive into some of the grittier aspects of data cleaning. You'll learn about string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, and then explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data. You'll also learn the valuable skill of programmatically checking your data for consistency, which will give you confidence that your code is running correctly and that the results of your analysis are reliable!

In this final chapter, you'll apply all of the data cleaning techniques you've learned in this course towards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation. Once you're done, not only will you have a clean and tidy dataset, you'll also be ready to start working on your own data science projects using the power of Python!
