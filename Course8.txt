, you will be introduced to Panda's DataFrames. You will use Pandas to import and inspect a variety of datasets, ranging from population data obtained from The World Bank to monthly stock data obtained via Yahoo! Finance. You will also practice building DataFrames from scratch, and become familiar with Pandas' intrinsic data visualization capabilities.

Having learned how to ingest and inspect your data, you will next explore it visually as well as quantitatively. This process, known as exploratory data analysis (EDA), is a crucial component of any data science project. Pandas has powerful methods that help with statistical and visual EDA. In this chapter, you will learn how and when to apply these techniques.

Time series in pandas
0%
In this chapter, you will learn how to manipulate and visualize time series data using Pandas. You will become familiar with concepts such as upsampling, downsampling, and interpolation. You will practice using Pandas' method chaining to efficiently filter your data and perform time series analyses. From stock prices to flight timings, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains and being able to effectively work with such data can be an invaluable skill.
