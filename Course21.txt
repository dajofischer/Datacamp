Optimizing a neural network with backward propagation
0%
Here, you'll learn how to optimize the predictions generated by your neural networks. You'll do this using a method called backward propagation, which is one of the most important techniques in deep learning. Understanding how it works will give you a strong foundation to build from in the second half of the course.
