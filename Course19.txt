Creating a simple first model
0%
In this chapter, you'll build a first-pass model. You'll use numeric data only to train the model. Spoiler alert - throwing out all of the text data is bad for performance! But you'll learn how to format your predictions. Then, you'll be introduced to natural language processing (NLP) in order to start working with the large amounts of text in the data.

Improving your model
0%
Here, you'll improve on your benchmark model using pipelines. Because the budget consists of both text and numeric data, you'll learn to how build pipielines that process multiple types of data. You'll also explore how the flexibility of the pipeline workflow makes testing different approaches efficient, even in complicated problems like this one!
