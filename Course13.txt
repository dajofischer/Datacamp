Plotting 2D arrays
0%
This chapter showcases various techniques for visualizing two-dimensional arrays. This includes the use, presentation, and orientation of grids for representing two-variable functions followed by discussions of pseudocolor plots, contour plots, color maps, two-dimensional histograms, and images.

Statistical plots with Seaborn
0%
This is a high-level tour of the Seaborn plotting library for producing statistical graphics in Python. The tour covers Seaborn tools for computing and visualizing linear regressions as well as tools for visualizing univariate distributions (e.g., strip, swarm, and violin plots) and multivariate distributions (e.g., joint plots, pair plots, and heatmaps). This also includes a discussion of grouping categories in plots.
