Concatenating data
0%
Having learned how to import multiple DataFrames and share information using Indexes, in this chapter you'll learn how to perform database-style operations to combine DataFrames. In particular, you'll learn about appending and concatenating DataFrames while working with a variety of real-world datasets.

Merging data
0%
Here, you'll learn all about merging pandas DataFrames. You'll explore different techniques for merging, and learn about left joins, right joins, inner joins, and outer joins, as well as when to use which. You'll also learn about ordered merging, which is useful when you want to merge DataFrames whose columns have natural orderings, like date-time columns.

To cement your new skills, you'll apply them by working on an in-depth study involving Olympic medal data. The analysis involves integrating your multi-DataFrame skills from this course and also skills you've gained in previous pandas courses. This is a rich dataset that will allow you to fully leverage your pandas data manipulation skills. Enjoy!
