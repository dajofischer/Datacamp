rence techniques, you should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data. So it is a fitting subject for the first chapter of Statistical Thinking in Python.

In the last chapter, you learned how to graphically explore data. In this chapter, you will compute useful summary statistics, which serve to concisely describe salient features of a data set with a few numbers.

Thinking probabilistically-- Discrete variables
0%
Statistical inference rests upon probability. Because we can very rarely say anything meaningful with absolute certainty from data, we use probabilistic language to make quantitative statements about data. In this chapter, you will learn how to think probabilistically about discrete quantities, those that can only take certain values, like integers. It is an important first step in building the probabilistic language necessary to think statistically.

Thinking probabilistically-- Continuous variables

In the last chapter, you learned about probability distributions of discrete variables. Now it is time to move on to continuous variables, such as those that can take on any fractional value. Many of the principles are the same, but there are some subtleties. At the end of this last chapter of the course, you will be speaking the probabilistic language you need to launch into the inference techniques covered in the sequel to this course.
